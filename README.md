# IoT Weather App

IoT Weather App is a web application designed to monitor weather conditions. The weather data is collected by a custom-built weather station using ESP32 and various sensors, then transmitted to the application via MQTT for visualization.

This project was developed as part of an IoT course at university.

## Features

- **Weather Monitoring**: Displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and more.
- **IoT Weather Station**: Data is collected using an ESP32 microcontroller and multiple sensors.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript for improved code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for custom and responsive styling.
- **Auth.js**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **MQTT**: Enables lightweight messaging between the IoT weather station and the application.
